# WhatDidUSay
IOS app project for recording audio snipets of the past.

# Code:
The origional code has been done in Objective C.
Please feel free to download and run the sample code for clarity of functionality.
The sample code is not very well commented, nevertheless the purpose of this code is to demonmstrate intended functionality.
It is our intention to rewrite the entire program in Swift.

# Function:
The app is constantly listening to audio from the mic by recording in a loop format.
ie each recording overwrites the previous recording.
Each time the "Zap Em" button is hit, the last 10 seconds of the looped recording is saved and stored into memory.
The 10 second audio snippet is then available for listening in the table view below.
Meanwhile the app continues listening until the stop button is tapped.

# Coderz:
